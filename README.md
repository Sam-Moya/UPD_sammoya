we started with 

npm init --y  :: creates a package.json file that does...something
npm i -D ts-node typescript  :: adds 20 packages and audits 21? ok
npm i @solana/web3.js bs58  :: adds 57 packages and audits 78? sure

the above 3 lines of code go into the terminal at the bottom of github codespaces

created a .ts file? what dis? what does this do? why .ts specifically
